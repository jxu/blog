# Wake Me Up When September Ends

## 1. Intro

To make up for the lack of blog posts in the past six years, I'm experimenting with making one mini-blog post a day for the month of September. It's a bit like NaNoWriMo in spirit, except less creative and much less demanding (they expect on average 1,667 words per day!). Usually it'll be short posts on things I've thought about over the years that don't deserve a full blog post. I can't promise (myself) they'll come out every day, but there will eventually be one per day here.

## 2. Readability

I consider my writing style to be pretty plain and understandable, but online readability scorers put my writing as high school to college level, that is "difficult" to "professional". My previous post about the CLRS book was universally considered difficult, due to the jargon and many-syllable words used. Aside from specific jargon, I am pretty sure a middle schooler could understand my writing reasonably well, even if it comes off as wordy. I try not to be wordy as ChatGPT is notorious for being, but also maintain an informal, conversational tone for the blog. My old writing had more very long sentences, even if not technically run-on, and in recent years I've consciously made my sentences shorter.

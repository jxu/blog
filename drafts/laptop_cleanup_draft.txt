Use baobab / Disk Usage Analyzer which immediatedly shows the biggest directories (apparently a more recent version shows large individual files https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/baobab/-/issues/22)

Trash: 116 GB (hundreds)
accumulated over months of "maybe" needing some files, including manmy downloaded videos and large binaries. I deleted all of them.

Videos:
some class videos not uploaded to youtube moved to temp external hard drive to be deleted later once I verify none are needed.

snaps: 12 GB 
snap keeps two versions, probably for rollback purposes
also different versions of gnome like 3.26, 3.28, etc are kept
large snaps are several hundred megabytes
maybe I will get rid of snap completely. for another blogpost

nsight-compute and nsight-systems: /opt/nvidia 1.1 GB
probably installed accidentally when I was messing with drivers

cuda-11.3 samples which are just fun demos but not needed: 2.0 GB

Old Mathematica 12.0 install in usr/local: 9.4 GB. Have new version installed. Half the size is documentation

Note: root trash is different than user trash! this is shown by giving sudo permissions to baobab. 

TexLive: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/119759/why-cant-tex-lives-size-be-reduced 
I never use the docs because it's faster just to lookup things online such as on TeX stackexchange.

texlive-full docs: 2.5 GB
texmf-dist/fonts 2.3 GB

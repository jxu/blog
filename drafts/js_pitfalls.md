`writeln` because `print` goes to printer
optional semicolons
`for of` vs `for in`
`var` vs `let`, block scope, hoisting
strict mode "use strict" (like perl and PHP)
use of charAt, substring, slicing instead of indexing
type conversion "magic" (sec 3.9)
flexible equality `==` comparisons
prototypal inheritance (not a bad thing, just different)
no operator overloading
getters/setters and "hidden functions"
falsey values (undefined, null, NaN)
null and undefined, typeof null as object
The global object
parseInt and parseFloat ignoring later characters
Array out-of-bound accesses are just undefined (comes from indices being like special object properties)
Strings using UTF-16 instead of UTF-8
Promise chains and the difference between resolved/fulfilled

Obscure
ES6 Symbols
conditional property access
regex literals


bonus advanced things (mostly from ECMAScript 6):
arrow anonymous functions (more succinct than python lambda)
template literals (like python triple-quoted strings and f-strings)
advanced: closures (a good thing, with environments like R)
destructuring assignment and triple dots spread operator (like python unpacking)

<h1 class="title">Blog Downgrade</h1>
</header>
<p>
  Today I finally got around to downgrading my blog.
  I call it a "downgrade" because it's less modern looking, but I consider it a refresh stylistically as I prefer the "old internet" HTML 1.0 look.
  The look is inspired by GNU manuals (actually, the GCC docs have slightly more styling).

  There was nothing really wrong with Jekyll, the previous static blog site generator.
  The only very minor gripes are that it required me installing Ruby, and the site layout files including SCSS took a little while to figure out.
  Now, I write my posts in pure HTML.
  Most of it is text anyway with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags.
  Working hands-on with raw HTML is a good learning experience in my view.
  (I always have a tab to MDN open.)

<p>Youtube's app used to be my go-to for watching Youtube because the
app seemed easier to use. However after an increase in very annoying ads
and another UI change, I changed to watching Youtube on Firefox, which
actually has most of the basic functionality of the app. Firefox is a
nice browser that supports browser extensions, so I can use the
well-known content blocker uBlock Origin. Seeing that "blocked since
install" number is hugely satisfying. The most significant downside is
the lack of 60 fps playback.</p>
<p>Also, it's easy to download videos from Youtube without using their
stupid Youtube Premium service. I use this for watching videos when
traveling or when I don't want to waste mobile data. All that's needed
is the terminal environment <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a> and
the amazing video downloading tool <a
href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Give termux access to phone's filesystem with
<code>termux-setup-storage</code></p></li>
<li><p>Install python and ffmpeg (for youtube-dl) with
<code>pkg install python ffmpeg</code></p></li>
<li><p>Install youtube-dl through pip with
<code>pip install youtube-dl</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now I can download videos and play them through any video player like
VLC with</p>
<pre><code>cd storage/movies
youtube-dl [VIDEO_URL]</code></pre>
<p>Another tip: youtube-dl chooses the highest quality video by default.
For long videos or 4k videos, this can lead to very large file sizes.
Specifying format code 22 with <code>-f22</code> will select a 720p
version with video and audio. This can be half the size of the 1080p
version and a tenth the size of the 4k version, and usually better. As a
small bonus, there is no need to wait for youtube-dl to download a
separate audio stream and ffmpeg to mux the audio and video
together.</p>

<h1 id="wake-me-up-when-september-ends">Wake Me Up When September
Ends</h1>
<p>To make up for the lack of blog posts in the past six years, I'm
experimenting with making one mini-blog post a day for the month of
September. It's a bit like NaNoWriMo in spirit, except less creative and
much less demanding (they expect on average 1,667 words per day!).
Usually it'll be short posts on things I've thought about over the years
that don't deserve a full blog post. I can't promise (myself) they'll
come out every day, but there will eventually be one per day here.</p>

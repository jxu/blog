<p>So September has ended and clearly I did not post daily. I found out I should’ve stockpiled drafts because I always want to write more than a paragraph for each topic. Still, I don’t consider it a complete failure because it stimulated some writing, more than I have ever done. See you for the next yearly post.</p>
